cmsearch-deoverlap.pl: remove lower scoring overlaps from cmsearch
                       --tblout files.

Usage:
$ perl ./cmsearch-deoverlap.pl 
cmsearch-deoverlap v0.09 [Aug 2023]

Usage:

cmsearch-deoverlap.pl    [OPTIONS] <tblout file>
	OR
cmsearch-deoverlap.pl -l [OPTIONS] <list of tblout files>

	OPTIONS:
		-l               : single command line argument is a list of tblout files, not a single tblout file
		-s               : sort hits by bit score [default: sort by E-value]
		-d               : run in debugging mode (prints extra info)
		-v               : run in verbose mode (prints all removed and kept hits)
		--noverlap <n>   : define an overlap as >= <n> or more overlapping residues [1]
		--nhmmer         : tblout files are from nhmmer v3.x
		--hmmsearch      : tblout files are from hmmsearch v3.x
		--cmscan         : tblout files are from cmscan v1.1x, not cmsearch
		--fcmsearch      : assert tblout files are cmsearch not cmscan
		--besthmm        : with --hmmsearch, sort by evalue/score of *best* single hit not evalue/score of full seq
		--clanin <s>     : only remove overlaps within clans, read clan info from file <s> [default: remove all overlaps]
		--invclan        : w/--clanin, invert clan behavior: do not remove overlaps within clans, remove all other overlaps
		--maxkeep        : keep hits that only overlap with other hits that are not kept [default: remove all hits with higher scoring overlap]
		--overlapout <s> : create new tabular file with overlap information in <s>
		--mdllenin <s>   : w/--overlapout, read model lengths from two-token-per-line-file <s>
		--dirty          : keep intermediate files (sorted tblout files)

EXAMPLES
--------

1. Remove overlapping hits to models in the same clan in a single tblout
file:
$ perl ./cmsearch-deoverlap.pl --clanin ribo.claninfo testfiles/1.cmsearch.tblout
Saved   357 hits (  614 removed) to testfiles/1.cmsearch.tblout.deoverlapped

--
2. Remove overlapping hits to models in the same clan in each tblout
files from a list:

$ perl ./cmsearch-deoverlap.pl --clanin ribo.claninfo -l testfiles/file.list
Saved   357 hits (  614 removed) to testfiles/1.cmsearch.tblout.deoverlapped
Saved   325 hits (  596 removed) to testfiles/2.cmsearch.tblout.deoverlapped
Saved   377 hits (  644 removed) to testfiles/3.cmsearch.tblout.deoverlapped

--
3. Remove all overlapping hits in a single tblout file:

$ perl ./cmsearch-deoverlap.pl testfiles/1.cmsearch.tblout
Saved   357 hits (  614 removed) to testfiles/1.cmsearch.tblout.deoverlapped

-------
TESTING
-------
There are cmsearch and cmscan tblout files in the directory testfiles/
that were created with this bsub script using Infernal 1.1.2:

for i in 1 2 3; do 
    bsub -n 4 -J cmsearch.$i -o /dev/null -e $i.cmsearch.err -M 12000 -R "rusage[mem=12000]" "time cmsearch -Z 1000 --hmmonly --cut_ga --cpu 4 --noali --tblout $i.cmsearch.tblout ribo.cm 50000.$i.fa >  $i.cmsearch.out"
    bsub -n 4 -J cmscan.clan.$i -o /dev/null -e $i.cmsearch.err -M 12000 -R "rusage[mem=12000]" "time cmscan -Z 1000 --hmmonly --cut_ga --cpu 4 --noali --fmt 2 --oskip --oclan --clanin ribo.claninfo --tblout $i.cmscan.clan.tblout ribo.cm 50000.$i.fa >  $i.cmscan.clan.out"
    bsub -n 4 -J cmscan.clan.$i -o /dev/null -e $i.cmsearch.err -M 12000 -R "rusage[mem=12000]" "time cmscan -Z 1000 --hmmonly --cut_ga --cpu 4 --noali --fmt 2 --oskip --tblout $i.cmscan.noclan.tblout ribo.cm 50000.$i.fa >  $i.cmscan.noclan.out"
done

The models used were Rfam 12.2 models, and here's the cmstat outptu:

The file 'test.sh' will run a set of tests that check that the main
script cmsearch-deoverlap.pl is working properly for parsing cmsearch
tblout files. *It does not currently do any checks to see if the 
--nhmmer or --hmmsearch options are working properly for removing
overlaps from nhmmer and hmmsearch output.

Here is that file:
$ cat test.sh
perl ./check-cmsearch-v-cmscan.pl testfiles/1.cmsearch.tblout testfiles/1.cmscan.noclan.tblout
perl ./check-cmsearch-v-cmscan.pl testfiles/2.cmsearch.tblout testfiles/2.cmscan.noclan.tblout
perl ./check-cmsearch-v-cmscan.pl testfiles/3.cmsearch.tblout testfiles/3.cmscan.noclan.tblout

perl ./check-cmsearch-v-cmscan.pl --clanin ribo.claninfo testfiles/1.cmsearch.tblout testfiles/1.cmscan.clan.tblout
perl ./check-cmsearch-v-cmscan.pl --clanin ribo.claninfo testfiles/2.cmsearch.tblout testfiles/2.cmscan.clan.tblout
perl ./check-cmsearch-v-cmscan.pl --clanin ribo.claninfo testfiles/3.cmsearch.tblout testfiles/3.cmscan.clan.tblout

Here is the expected output of that script:
$ sh test.sh
Saved   357 hits (  614 removed) to testfiles/1.cmsearch.tblout.deoverlapped
Files are identical
Saved   325 hits (  596 removed) to testfiles/2.cmsearch.tblout.deoverlapped
Files are identical
Saved   377 hits (  644 removed) to testfiles/3.cmsearch.tblout.deoverlapped
Files are identical
Saved   357 hits (  614 removed) to testfiles/1.cmsearch.tblout.deoverlapped
Files are identical
Saved   325 hits (  596 removed) to testfiles/2.cmsearch.tblout.deoverlapped
Files are identical
Saved   377 hits (  644 removed) to testfiles/3.cmsearch.tblout.deoverlapped
Files are identical

This test indicates that cmsearch-deoverlap.pl removes overlapping
hits in an identical manner to cmscan version 1.1.2.
